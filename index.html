        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          I am a fourth year Computer Science Engineering student at East West
          University, majoring in Intelligent Systems and Data Science. My
          academic journey has been driven by a passion for exploring how
          intelligent technologies and data-driven solutions can address
          real-world challenges. I have developed a strong foundation in
          programming, artificial intelligence, and data science through
          hands-on projects, research, and academic involvement. Currently, I am
          working as an Undergraduate Teaching Assistant at East West
          University, where I assist in delivering lectures, leading lab
          sessions, and providing academic support for courses such as
          Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), Computer Aided Engineering Drawing,
          and Artificial Intelligence(AI). My responsibilities include
          one-on-one and group tutoring, preparing instructional materials,
          facilitating practical learning environments, and contributing to
          research and AI lab resource management. This experience has not only
          deepened my technical expertise but also strengthened my
          communication, leadership, and mentoring skills. I am continually
          seeking opportunities to grow as a researcher and engineer, with a
          long-term goal of contributing to impactful and innovative tech
          solutions in the field of AI and Data Science.
